Airshow Database Application

This is a simple web application written in JSP and Java which uses MySQl as
database back end to store persisten information. There are two main components
for this project:
 
 1. The ability to register new participant to the airshow and manage the 
    registration forms 

 2. Store and retrieve score information about the planes that participate
    in the competition
